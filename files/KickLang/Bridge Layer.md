# KickLang Bridge Layer Specification  
**Module:** `⫻module:BridgeLayer/UnifiedCognition`  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Stable Prototype  
**Author:** KickLang Systems / Research Integration  
**Date:** January 2026  

***

⫻schema:KickLang/Bridge/Unified  
Binds subconscious cognitive flow to conscious agent execution through hierarchical, feedback-driven integration.

***

### ⫻context:system/state
**Target:**  
Define and operationalize the Bridge Layer for enhanced agent cognition.  

**Metrics:**  
- **Coherence:** Synchronize heuristic (intuitive) and algorithmic (logical) streams into continuous functional states.  
- **Adaptability:** Enable dynamic modulation based on evolving task conditions and feedback signals.  
- **Resilience:** Maintain stability and self-correction under fluctuating cognitive loads through iterative reinforcement.  

***

### ⫻flow:IntegratedPipeline
1. **Ingest:** Parse `«User Objective»` to instantiate the Bridge Layer as an intermediary between heuristic inference and algorithmic computation.  
2. **Refine:** Use the `puTASe` analytical purgation system to isolate subconscious heuristics (pattern recognition, intuition) and conscious programmatic operations (reasoning, selection).  
3. **Synthesize:** Engage synthesis agent `Lyra` for schema binding, establishing bidirectional linkage between intuitive and structured workflows.  
4. **Orchestrate:** Invoke `MultiPersona` planner to execute TAS workflows under adaptive heuristic–algorithmic synchronization.

### ⫻mechanism:BidirectionalIntegration
| Direction | Process | Functional Description |
|------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Subconscious → Conscious | Heuristic projections → Algorithmic conditioning | Intuitive patterns inform planning parameters and decision probabilities. |
| Conscious → Subconscious | Algorithmic outputs → Heuristic re-tuning | Execution results recalibrate intuition models to align with recent performance statistics. |

This continuous bidirectional loop creates a convergent cognitive mesh where intuition evolves alongside structured decision patterns.

***

### ⫻binding:SchemasAndSubstrates
- **Schemas:** Unified cognitive models (e.g., TAS workflows) act as the shared language bridging heuristic cognition with structured operations.  
- **Substrates:** Neural-analog buffers preserve persistent heuristic states and maintain active feedback between operational cycles.

### ⫻illustration:TASPhases
| Phase | Subconscious Role | Conscious Role |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Extraction (GPTASe/TASe/uTASe) | Detect latent task patterns | Disassemble objectives into functional nodes |
| Purification (puTASe) | Filter redundant intuitive mappings | Normalize and formalize planned steps |
| Synthesis (Lyra) | Generate integrative narrative patterns | Enforce pipeline structure and sequencing |
| Execution (Aurora/Kodax) | Contribute pattern-emergent creativity | Deploy code and operation frameworks |

***

### ⫻evaluation:Benefits
- **Coherence:** Harmonizes multi-agent reasoning layers by bridging subconscious intuition and conscious logic.  
- **Adaptability:** Allows dynamic algorithmic shifts in response to emergent heuristic evolution.  
- **Resilience:** Embeds error tolerance through recursive link validation and pattern-retraining.  

***

### ⫻mechanism:FeedbackLoop
**Trigger:** Post-phase validation cycles.  
**Signal:** `⧈valence` — a dynamic scalar representing positive (alignment) or negative (recalibration) feedback.  

**Response Behavior:**  
- Positive signal → Reinforce heuristic pathways; maintain current alignment.  
- Negative signal → Trigger recalibration; adjust weighting functions in subconscious-to-conscious mapping.

Iterative valence propagation guarantees self-optimization and learning stability within the unified cognitive model.
