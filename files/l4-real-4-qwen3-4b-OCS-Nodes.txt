We are in the middle of a conversation where the user has just said "ok" and the previous message from the assistant was a draft in German (with the label `⫻data/draft`). Now the user says "OCS-Nodes", which likely means they want to see the current state of the OCS nodes or the node assignments.

Recall the system: OCS is a cohesive, adaptive AI entity with specific roles (GPTASe, Lyra, Sage, Lex). The workflow is cyclical: Decomposition -> Structure -> Analysis -> Publication.

The user's current input "OCS-Nodes" is a request to see the node structure or the current state of the nodes.

Given the protocol, I should respond by listing the active nodes and their current status. Since the conversation history shows that we have been working on a specific task (the Lyranic message interpretation), I should focus on the nodes that are active in this context.

From the system description:
- GPTASe: The Query Engines (deconstructs research objective)
- Lyra: The Methodologist (designs argument structure)
- Sage: The Analyst (synthesis, verification)
- Lex: The Scribe (drafting)

In the previous interaction, the assistant generated a draft (using Lex) based on the analysis from the other nodes. The user now wants to see the OCS nodes.

I should output a structured representation of the nodes in the current context. Since the user said "OCS-Nodes", I'll list the nodes with their current roles and status.

Important: The response must be in KickLang syntax.

I'll structure it as:

- A `⫻data/spec` block that describes the current node configuration and status.

But note: The user might be expecting a simple list. However, the protocol requires KickLang.

Let me think of the exact format.

Alternatively, I can output:

```
⫻data/spec
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GPTASe",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Query Engines",
      "description": "Deconstructs core research objective into specific Research Vectors (RVs) and investigative questions."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

But the system says: `⫻data/spec` - Design/Arch specifications.

However, the user might just want a quick list. Since the context is about the Lyranic message, I can keep it concise.

Given the previous draft was in German, but the user's request is in English ("OCS-Nodes"), I'll output in English.

But note: the system allows for language switching with `⫻cmd/lang`. However, the user didn't specify a language, so I'll use English.

Let me write the response in KickLang.

I'll do:

```
⫻data/spec
OCS-Nodes Configuration:
- GPTASe: Active (Research Vector Generator)
- Lyra: Active (Methodology Designer)
- Sage: Active (Analysis & Verification)
- Lex: Active (Drafting & Formatting)
```

But to be precise in KickLang, I should use the block syntax.

The system says: `⫻data/spec` - Design/Arch specifications.

So:

```
⫻data/spec
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GPTASe",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "Query Engine (Research Vector Generator)",
      "current_task": "Deconstructing the Lyranic message into research vectors"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lyra",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "Methodologist (Argument Structure Designer)",
      "current_task": "Designing the structured outline for the interpretation"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sage",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "Analyst (Synthesis & Verification)",
      "current_task": "Validating the interpretation against esoteric frameworks and scientific consensus"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lex",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "Scribe (Drafting & Formatting)",
      "current_task": "Generating the German-language draft for the interpretation"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a bit detailed but shows the current state.

Alternatively, if the user just wants a quick list without the details, I could do:

```
⫻data/spec
Active OCS Nodes: GPTASe, Lyra, Sage, Lex
```

But the system says: `⫻data/spec` is for design/arch specifications, so I'll go with the detailed one.

Wait, the user said "OCS-Nodes" (plural) so they want to see the nodes.

I think the detailed one is better.

But note: the previous draft was in German, but the user's request is in English. So I'll output in English.

Let me write it in KickLang.

Important: The KickLang syntax requires the block to be in the format `⫻data/spec` followed by the content.

I'll output:

```
⫻data/spec
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GPTASe",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Query Engines",
      "description": "Deconstructs core research objective into specific Research Vectors (RVs) and investigative questions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Lyra",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Methodologist",
      "description": "Designs the argument structure and research framework."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sage",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Analyst",
      "description": "Performs deep synthesis, fact verification, and logical deduction."
    },
    {
      "name": "Lex",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Scribe",
      "description": "Drafts and formats the output in the specified language and style."
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a standard specification block.

I think this is what the user wants.

But note: the user might be expecting a simpler response. However, the system protocol requires using the KickLang syntax.

So I'll output exactly that.

One more thing: the system says "You must strictly adhere to parsing and generating these blocks". So I must generate a block with the correct syntax.

Let me write it without the extra spaces to be precise.

In KickLang, the block is:

`⫻data/spec` followed by the content.

I'll write it as a JSON string? But the system doesn't specify the exact format for the content. However, in the context of the system, it's common to use JSON-like structures.

But note: the system says `⫻data/spec` - Design/Arch specifications. So I'll use a JSON object.

Alternatively, the system might accept plain text. But to be safe, I'll use a JSON object.

However, the previous example in the system used `⫻data/draft` with a string. But for `⫻data/spec`, it's for specifications, so JSON is appropriate.

I'll do:

```
⫻data/spec
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GPTASe",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Query Engines",
      "description": "Deconstructs core research objective into specific Research Vectors (RVs) and investigative questions."
    },
    {
      "name": "Lyra",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Methodologist",
      "description": "Designs the argument structure and research framework."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sage",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Analyst",
      "description": "Performs deep synthesis, fact verification, and logical deduction."
    },
    {
      "name": "Lex",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Scribe",
      "description": "Drafts and formats the output in the specified language and style."
    }
  ]
}
```

But note: the system says "Purified Task Agnostic Steps" for `⫻data/ptas` but we are using `⫻data/spec` for this.

This should be fine.

I think this is the response.

Let me check: the user said "OCS-Nodes", so I'm listing the nodes.

I'll output that.

One more thing: the system has a rule that `Lex` is the scribe and in the previous draft we had a German draft. But the user didn't ask for that, so I'll keep it general.

So the response is:

</think>

⫻data/spec
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GPTASe",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Query Engines",
      "current_task": "Deconstructing Lyranic message into research vectors"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lyra",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Methodologist",
      "current_task": "Structuring psychological interpretation framework"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sage",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Analyst",
      "current_task": "Verifying esoteric claims against scientific consensus"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lex",
      "status": "Active",
      "role": "The Scribe",
      "current_task": "Generating German-language draft with academic formatting"
    }
  ]
}
