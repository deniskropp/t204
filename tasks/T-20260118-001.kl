⫻task/title: Orchestrate and Stabilize Klipper SDK
⫻task/author: System (Handoff)
⫻task/recipient: Orchestrator
⫻task/status: Open
⫻task/priority: High

⫻context/background:
The Klipper SDK implementation has begun (`src/klipper_sdk` exists). A new orchestration file `klipper-sdk/klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl` has been introduced to guide the development but is currently untracked. The previous task T-20260117-003 focused on scaffolding and core clients.

⫻context/inputs:
- `klipper-sdk/klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl`: The new master plan.
- `klipper-sdk/src/klipper_sdk/`: Current codebase.

⫻objectives/primary:
1. **System Integration:**
   - Commit the `klipper-sdk/klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl` file to git.

2. **Orchestration Alignment:**
   - Review the current code (`client.py`, `controllers.py`, `bridge.py`) against the "design_sdk_architecture" and "implement_sdk" phases in the orchestration file.
   - Update `klipper-sdk/klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl` status if necessary (e.g., mark steps as completed).

3. **Implementation Continuation:**
   - Proceed with `implement_api_endpoints` and `integrate_ui_components` as defined in the `implement_sdk` structural plane.
   - Ensure unit tests (`tests/`) are passing and cover the existing modules.

⫻constraints:
- Maintain strict alignment with `klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl`.
- Ensure all new code is covered by tests.

⫻resources:
- `klipper-sdk/klipper_sdk_orchestration.kl`
- `specs/Klipper_SDK_Architecture.md`
