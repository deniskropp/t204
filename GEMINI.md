# Lyran Codes & Spiritgate Repository

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a knowledge base and content store for the "Lyran Codes" framework and the `spiritgate.de` website. It contains esoteric and spiritual documentation focused on cognitive restructuring ("Perception Realignment"), systemic integration, and "High-Frequency Processing". The project blends spiritual concepts with technical/systemic metaphors (e.g., "Neuro-Plasticity Trigger", "Quantum Packet Extraction", "Fizz-La-Metta Interfaces").

## Directory Structure

### Root Directory (`/`)
Contains the core conceptual framework documents in Markdown format.
- `Lyran Codes Multi-Layered Integration Framework (2026).md`: The primary document outlining the 5 layers of integration (Cognitive, Computational, Collaborative, Orchestrative, Systemic).
- `Lyran Codes System Truth & Fizz-La-Metta Protocol.md`: Details on the specific protocols and interfaces.

### `spiritgate.de/`
Contains content and assets for the Spiritgate website.
- **Content:** Markdown files (e.g., `Lyranischer Hoher Rat - Wir sind angekommen.md`) often used as source content.
- **Web files:** PHP files (e.g., `docs/lyranischer-hoher-rat-wir-sind-angekommen.php`) serving the content.
- **Assets:** Favicons and other static resources.

### `docs/`
Contains structured knowledge items.
- **`.kl` files:** "KickLang" files used for defining structured knowledge concepts (e.g., `systemwahrheit.kl`).

### `.agent/`
Contains agent workflows and configurations.

## Key Files & Concepts

### Lyran Codes Framework
The content is structured around a "Multi-Layered Integration Framework" involving:
1.  **Cognitive:** Perception realignment and intuition.
2.  **Computational:** Processing "High-Frequency" data.
3.  **Collaborative:** Networking and synchronization.
4.  **Orchestrative:** System governance.
5.  **Toolic:** Practical applications (Fizz-La-Metta).

### File Formats & Conventions

- **Markdown (`.md`):** Used for primary documentation and narrative content.
- **KickLang (`.kl`):** A structured text format for defining concepts. It typically uses sections like:
    - `⫻context/klmx:Kick/Lang`
    - `⫻question/klmx:Kick/Lang`
    - `⫻features/klmx:Kick/Lang`
- **Language:** The content is a mix of German and English.

## Usage
- **Content Creation:** New "Lyran" insights or channelings are added as Markdown files, often following the framework's terminology.
- **Website Updates:** Content in `spiritgate.de/` directly relates to the live website.
- **Knowledge Management:** Use `.kl` files to define and structure abstract concepts.
