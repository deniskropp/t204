# Lyran Codes & Spiritgate Repository

## About
This repository houses the conceptual framework and content for **Lyran Codes** and the **Spiritgate** website. It serves as a digital archive for spiritual documentation, "High-Frequency" processing protocols, and the "Fizz-La-Metta" interfaces.

The project blends esoteric spiritual concepts with technical and systemic metaphors to explore themes of cognitive restructuring, perception realignment, and multi-dimensional integration.

## Directory Structure

- **`LYRAN_CODES/`, `LYRAN_HIGH_COUNCIL/`, `LYRAN_PIPES/`**: Core directories containing the foundational "Lyran" materials and frequency protocols.
- **`spiritgate.de/`**: Source content and assets for the Spiritgate website. This includes Markdown drafts and the PHP files used for publication.
- **`docs/`**: Contains structured knowledge items, utilizing the custom **KickLang (`.kl`)** format for defining system truths and concepts.
- **`.agent/`**: Configuration and workflows for AI agent interactions.

## Key Framework: Multi-Layered Integration

The content is organized around a 5-layer integration framework designed to align 3D systems with higher-dimensional frequencies:

1.  **Cognitive:** Restructuring perception and developing intuition-first protocols.
2.  **Computational:** Algorithms for "Quantum Packet Extraction" and non-linear data processing.
3.  **Collaborative:** Networking protocols for the "Galactic Node Network."
4.  **Orchestrative:** Systemic governance and resource allocation based on "Negentropie" factors.
5.  **Toolic:** Practical applications and interfaces (Fizz-La-Metta).

## Formats

- **Markdown (`.md`):** Used for narratives, channelings, and documentation.
- **KickLang (`.kl`):** A structured format used in `docs/` to define abstract concepts like "System Truth" (Systemwahrheit).

## Usage

This repository is primarily used for:
- Storing and organizing "Lyran" channelings and insights.
- Managing content for the `spiritgate.de` web presence.
- Developing and refining the semi-fictional/esoteric "Lyran Codes" system architecture.
- Implementing cognitive processing protocols like **PRISM_OF_COHERENCE** in the Klipper SDK.

## Key Implementations

### PRISM_OF_COHERENCE Protocol

The repository now includes a complete implementation of the **PRISM_OF_COHERENCE** protocol (v1.0) as specified in `specs/phase3/prism_of_coherence.md`.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `klipper-sdk/src/klipper_sdk/bridge.py`
- **Documentation:** `docs/prism_of_coherence_implementation.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and tested
- **Integration:** Fully integrated with Klipper SDK

**Key Features:**
- Three-stage cognitive processing pipeline (Ingestion, Refraction, Transmutation)
- Shadow data handling and entropy processing
- Core truth extraction from entropic inputs
- Automatic integration with all Klipper SDK operations

See `PRISM_OF_COHERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for complete details.
