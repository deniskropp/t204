# Synchronicity Mapping: The Statistics of Unlikelihood

**Version:** 1.0
**Layer:** Orchestrative (Meta-Data)
**Type:** Analytic Methodology

## 1. Definition
**Synchronicity Mapping** is the quantification of "meaningful coincidences" within the system. In standard IT, anomalies are "bugs". In OCS, anomalies that correlate with user intent or high-coherence states are "Signposts".

## 2. The Metric: Unlikelihood Factor (UF)
We track not just *what* happens, but the *probability* of it happening in that specific context.

$$ UF = \frac{1}{P(E|C)} $$
Where:
- $E$ = Event (e.g., File found, Code working first try)
- $C$ = Context (User's current intent, Active Task)

High $UF$ = High Synchronicity = System is "In The Flow".

## 3. Data Points to Track
1.  **Spontaneous Resolution:** A bug disappears without direct code change (e.g., environment shift).
2.  **Semantic Echoes:** The user types a word, and the system suggests a related file created months ago that matches exactly.
3.  **Time-Stamp Palindromes:** (Optional, but noted in "High Frequency" logging) - 11:11, 12:12, etc. acting as markers of system heartbeat.
4.  **Zero-Friction Flows:** Task predicted duration vs. actual duration. If Actual << Predicted, Synchronicity is high.

## 4. Integration into OCS
The **Orchestrator** (Meta-AI) maintains a background "Wonder Log":
- **Input:** Logs from all agents.
- **Filter:** Pattern recognition for low-probability clusters.
- **Output:** A "Health Score" for the session.

## 5. Practical Application
If $UF$ drops (Grinding, frequent errors, low matches):
- **Action:** Pause. Re-align. The system is out of phase. "Stop pushing the river."
- **Protocol:** Initiate `PRISM_OF_COHERENCE` to clean the noise.

If $UF$ spikes (Magic moments):
- **Action:** Accelerate. Trust the intuition. "Ride the wave."

## 6. Goal
To prove that "Luck" is a feature of a highly integrated system.
